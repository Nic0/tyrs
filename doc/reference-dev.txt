Installation
------------

ArchLinux
~~~~~~~~~

As Tyrs is available in AUR, this installation is the most straightforward. Just use an
AUR helper such as 'Yaourt', and grab a copy from the user repository:

[source,bash]
yaourt -S tyrs

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tyrs requires some dependencies

* Python 2
* link:http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/[python-twitter]
* link:https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2[python-oauth2]

The installation will depend on your distribution, with debian or ubuntu it will be
[source,bash]
apt-get install python-twitter python-oauth2

.Issue with Ubuntu 11.04
[IMPORTANT]
================================
An issue was found with Ubuntu 11.04 and the current python-twitter package,
this hasn’t been fixed yet, but can be worked around if you install the last
library available. To do so, open a console and:
[source,bash]
apt-get remove python-twitter
wget http://python-twitter.googlecode.com/files/python-twitter-0.8.2.tar.gz
tar xvf python-twitter-0.8.2.tar.gz && cd python-twitter-0.8.2
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

=================================

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the package and dependencies, there are two way to get Tyrs installed:

* With _setup.py_, this allows a clean install, similar to the autotools for C
programs (`configure', `make', `make install')
* Just calling the main file as a python script will work fine as well

I'll decribe both ways, but I recommend you use the first solution.

First, get the last tarball (curently, the last one is the {revision}) +
http://src.nicosphere.net/tyrs/tyrs-{revision}.tar.gz

[source,bash]
tar xvf tyrs-0.1.3.tar.gz
cd tyrs

.With setup.py

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

Those commands decompress the tarball, go to the directory, prepare the
installation (you can check the files that will be install here), and then install
it. Note that _the last command must be issued as_ *root*. And that's all, just
run Tyrs with a simple:

[source,bash]
tyrs

.Without setup.py

You just need to to call it as a python script, the script is 'tyrs/tyrs.py'
so you need:

[source,bash]
python tyrs/tyrs.py

You may need to call Python2
python2 tyrs/tyrs.py

Github
~~~~~~

The development of Tyrs is based on link:https://github.com/Nic0/tyrs[Github],
you can easely get the lastest development version.

[source,bash]
git clone git://github.com/Nic0/tyrs.git

You may follow the same installation steps seen above to install and run the
git.

.Arch Linux
[TIP]
=================================
A package is available from AUR to retrieve the last verion from github.
[source,bash]
yaourt -S tyrs-git

=================================

Usage
-----

Please check the configuration section for a list of keybinding.

Activities bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The activities bar, is the bar containing information about your messages
(the 'H:0 M:0 D:0' on the top), this
displays new tweets in other buffers, for example if
you have new mentions in your timeline, the counter will increase.

A few  things to note:
* The current buffer is always set to zero, as your actually reading it, there
no need to increase it.
* On startup, other buffers are delayed for the
initially, so they won't display new counts until after the first update.

Console arguments
-----------------

There is more information on these commandes in each section (configuration and
installation).

* '-a', or '--account': source another account
* '-c', or '--config': source another config file
* '-g', or '--generate-config': generate a default configuration file.
* '-h', or '--help': help

[[configuration]]
Configuration
-------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tyrs is quite customizable.

It's based on the 'ConfigParser' core module from python, and it's a very
readable and to understand the syntax. All the configuration is based on this
schema:

A quick way to get started with configuration is to generate one from command
line. with the '-g' option (or '--generate-config'), this parameter take one
argument, the filename.

[source,bash]
tyrs -g ~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg

[source,conf]
------------
[section1]
param1 = string
param2 = 42
[section2]
other_param = otherValue
...
------------

So far, there are only three sections for configuration:

* *colors*: Customisation of colors.
* *keybinding*: Customisation of keys shortcuts.
* *params*: Other params.

NOTE: All sections and parameters are lower case, for params composed with two
words, they are separate with an underscore `'_'' (no camelCase).

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file is located in '~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg'.
You may have several configuration files, or account,
passed as an argument when you start Tyrs. The argument
is appended to the filename of the configuration.

.Custom config file
[source,bash]
$ tyrs -c foo

This will read the configuration from the '~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg.foo'.

CAUTION: You don't need to pass as an argument the full filename, as it will
attempt to read from some 'tyrs.cfg.tyrs.cfg.foo' file if you do so.

TIP: You may add some comments in your configuration file, you just need to
start the line with '#' or ';'.

Colors

Values possible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The possibles values are restricted with curse mode, here a list of available

them with one parameter, containing the list of elements you require to be
drown bold. +
As an example, to activate bold for highlight, warning_msg and
header. You do:

[source,conf]
---------------
[colors]
bold = highlight warning_msg header
---------------

That's all you need!

[NOTE]
=================
* You need to leave a space between each one, otherwise it won't work.
* This works as well with RGB colors.

Configuration 256 Colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea is to redefine a color using 256 colors. For example, green is
is not the hue you want, you can change it for a lighter one.
As 256 colors is not supported by all terminals, the default values is to set them off.


[IMPORTANT]
=====================
The format used, is a RGB code, it is defined with three
numbers from 0 to 1000. You *must* leave spaces between numbers in the
configuration file, for example:
[source,conf]
color_set3 = 300 400 500

====================

color_set0::
Redefine the Black.
color_set1::
Redefine the Red.
color_set2::
Redefine the Green.
color_set3::
Redefine the Yellow.
color_set4::
Redefine the Blue.
color_set5::
Redefine the Magenta.
color_set6::
Redefine the Cyan.
color_set7::
Redefine the White.

[IMPORTANT]
If you turn off one of them, for example you redefine green, and then change
your mind and revert to the default green, this will take effect only if
Important you restart your terminal. Otherwise, it will stay on the last color
defined. +
You don't need to restart your terminal if you just change the color setup with
another one, it will take effect immediatly after restarting Tyrs.


Key Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
^^^^^^^^

This allows you to change keys shortcuts to suit your needs. These are the defaults:

Caution You can’t have a ctrl-r and ctrl-R, only '^R' will work in
