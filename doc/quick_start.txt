Tyrs Quick Start
=================
:author: Nicolas Paris


This is a short introduction to using Tyrs, and doesn't go into
too much detail about configuration or installation. It is intended
to get you up and running Tyrs quickly.

For more information, you could read these documents:

* link:reference.html[Full documentation.]
* link:reference.html#installation[The installation guide.]

First authentication
--------------------

Both Twitter and Identi.ca use OAuth for authentication. The first step, with
both services, is to authenticate.

When you start the application, and it doesn't find a profile file, it will
print:

.Message when no profile is detected
--------------------
There is no profile detected.

The default location for a config file is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tyrs/tyrs.cfg which would usually be something like: /home/nicolas/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg

If you want to setup a new account, you are required to complete some basic
steps.
If you want to skip this, just press return or Ctrl-c.

Which service do you want to use?

1. Twitter
2. Identi.ca

Requesting temp token from Twitter

Please visit this Twitter page and retrieve the pincode to be used
in the next step for obtaining an Authentication Token:

https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=OxFDW4zW3YeiueuizjazAa4VSdeuieuiMO5b8GpS8EoDKRM

Pincode?
-------------------

You only need to go to the link show above, and copy the code that the
Twitter provides. And that's it, you are now able to access Twitter from your console.

[NOTE]
====================
For Identi.ca, one more question will be asked:
    Which root url do you want? (leave blank for default value, https://identi.ca/api)

If you are using identi.ca, leave the default value, and just press return. You
only need to change this if you have your own StatusNet server running.
====================

[TIP]
===================
If you have several accounts, you can specify which one to use by starting the application with
`-a` argument.
[source,bash]
tyrs -a foo

Configuration
-------------

You can use a configuration file, although there is no need to have one for Tyrs
to work, where you can customize your keybindings, color and basic behavior.

The default location for a configuration file is
'$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tyrs/tyrs.cfg' which would usually be something like:
'/home/nicolas/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg'

To learn how the configuration works, check the
link:reference.html#configuration[configuration part] of the reference guide.

[NOTE]
An easy way to start with the configuration file, it's to generate one from the
command line interface. It will generate a file with the required parameters
(you can then edit this file to suit your requirements).
[source,bash]
tyrs -g ~/.config/tyrs/tyrs.cfg

[TIP]
You may have more than one configuration file. To use an account-specific .cfg
file, start with a `-c` argument. (or `--config`)
